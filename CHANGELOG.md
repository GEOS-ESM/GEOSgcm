# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [11.1.0] - 2023-06-08

### Zero-diff to Previous Release: NO
### Restart Changes: NO

### Major Non-Zero-Diff Changes:
* Bugfix for GOCART: In dust and sea-salt, changed dimensions back to `globalCellCountPerDim` since these are needed to determine emission tuning parameters, not to allocate arrays. See changes [here](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GOCART/compare/sdr_v2.1.2.6...sdr_v2.1.2.7)
* Update to use NRL 2022 Solar Cycle File. Therefore, non-zero-diff results from Y2022 onward. [#468](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm_App/pull/468)
* Updates GEOSgcm to use [ESMA_env v4.17.0](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/ESMA_env/releases/tag/v4.17.0). This update mainly brings in ESMF v8.5.0b22 which is a non-zero-diff change for GEOSgcm due to precision changes in grid generation. It also brings in many new features for MAPL development.

### Major Zero-Diff Changes:
* Updates GEOSgcm to use [FVdycoreCubed_GridComp v2.4.4](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/FVdycoreCubed_GridComp/releases/tag/v2.4.4) and [GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere geos/v2.4.1](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere/releases/tag/geos%2Fv2.4.1). These updates bring in fixes for the FV3 standalone allowing it to work correctly. The GEOSgcm is zero-diff to these changes.

## [10.22.0] - 2022-03-15

### Zero-diff to Previous Release: NO
### Restart Changes: YES

Summary of changes for the refactored GOCART-2G:

* This is the first release of GEOSgcm that includes GOCART-2G, a refactoring of the GOCART component that adopts the ESMF for every child component and refactors the multi-instantiation mechanism. GOCART-2G only includes aerosols; other trace gases are not included by design.
* This release also includes new science, including the inclusion of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and Brown Carbon. In this implementation, Brown Carbon is comprise of that portion of Organic Carbon emitted by biomass burning, having absorptive properties.
* This release also introduces the notion of a "Process Library" which replaces what used to be found under Chem_Shared; it also eliminates any dependency on Chem_Base. The @GOCART repository is shared with NOAA and has been implemented in the UFS.
* Several new restarts (achem,cabc,cabr,caoc,du,ni,ss,su) have been added since the gridded components of GOCART-2G have been split out accordingly.
* GOCART-2G required changes in many other sub-repositories. Users are encouraged to look through those individually for a detailed list of changes.

### Zero-diff to previous release: MOSTLY
### Restart Changes: NO

Potential Non-0-diff Change:

1. Upgrade to MAPL v2.8.0. For the MERRA2 GOCART Emissions, all testing shows it is zero-diff. But for the Ops GOCART Emissions, it there are very small roundoff differences. The results are non-zero-diff due to a bug fix (to a race condition) in this version of MAPL on how grids are handled.

Major 0-diff Changes:
1. Detect MERRA2OX date violation during setup.
2. Make species consistent with emissions choice.
3. Only allow Rome nodes at NAS if built on Rome.

### Zero-diff to regridding: YES
### Restart Changes: NO
### History Changes: NO

Major changes include:

1. Upgrade to ESMA_env v3.2.0 whose main change is updating to ESMF 8.1.0, which is needed for MAPL development. All testing has shown it zero-diff to GEOSgcm with ESMF 8.0.1. Tests were run from C12 to C720 as well as Replay and MOM6. However, ESMF notes that there are [changes in some regridding situations which *could* produce non-zero-diff results](https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/releases/tag/ESMF_8_1_0).

## [10.17.5] - 2021-04-06

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES for hydrostatic, NO for nonhydrostatic
### Zero-diff to regridding: YES
### Restart Changes: NO
### History Changes: NO

Major changes include:

1. parallel_build.csh now accepts a `-hydrostatic` or `-nonhydrostatic` argument during building. If no argument is provided the model will build hydrostatically as before. Therefore, setup scripts were modified depending on what -DHYDROSTATIC option was supplied to CMake. If -DHYDROSTATIC=ON then it will assume the user wants to use hydrostatic dynamics options and vice versa.
2. Fixed decomposition regression for nonhydrostatic model.
3. Updates from ADAS 5.27 folded into git GMAO_Shared v1.3.9. This brings the GEOSadas code closer to the current GEOSgcm.

  * With this is included updating to latest releases of [ESMA_env](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/ESMA_env/releases) and [ESMA_cmake](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/ESMA_cmake/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) needed by MAPL 2.1
  * Add monthly mean features
  * Add optional equation of time correction to solar position used to calculate solar zenith angle.

## [10.12.2] - 2020-04-16

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES

### Restart Changes: NO except moist_import has an additional field: FRACI

Major changes are:

1. Added connectivity from MOIST to CHEM for 2 fields (RI and RL).
2. Updates to the obio component which was in the CVS Icarus-2.0 tag.
3. Bugfix for coupled mode renaming TSKINI to TSKINICE.
4. Bugfix for DTDT_moist which was initially set to temperature but never updated to provide tendency.
5. Compute the lightning flash rate (LFR) online following the approach used by GEOSCHEMchem_GridComp. The LFR is calculated in MOIST and then made available to other components as a new export field (LFR_GCC).
6. Modified the mk_Restarts script to run on SLES-12.
7. Update RRTMGP to Pincus 2020-Feb-12.
8. New Surface parameter resource file (GEOSsurface_GridComp/Shared/GEOS_SurfaceGridComp.rc) to avoid having to add new parameters into AGCM.rc.tmpl and prepare for further science development.
9. Correcting the following issues with the single column model: (1) GF imports from DYN were not filled; (2) scm_setup incompletely adjusted for L132; (3) SST file for cfmip_s11 case was incorrect.
10. Allows regrid.pl to run on SLES-12
11. Enabled compilation of convert_aerosols.x as R8

## [10.12.1] - 2020-03-27

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES

### Restart Changes: NO except moist_internal has an additional 3 fields: NGRAUPEL, NRAIN, NSNOW

Major changes are:

1. Broader support for various computing environments including SLES12. Adds a new question to gcm_setup (and other setup scripts) that asks a user what type of processor to run on. It then uses the "default" number of cores per those processors to better figure out how to handle the IOserver nodes.
2. Changes that enable MAPL2 GEOS to work with MPT at NCCS.
3. Changed REPLAY_Shutoff alarm from NON-STICKY to STICKY, and used it in GAAS to stop updates in forecasts during REPLAY mode.
4. Updates to moist and GOCART using 2MOMENT microphysics and MG3. These are 0-diff when running the default 1MOMENT microphysics.
5. Modified gcmpost.script to only operate on pressure-level collections.
6. Fixes issues where systems do not have either ImageMagick or F2Py. If F2Py is not found, then F2Py targets are not built.
7. Changes to GMAO_hermes:
   * Split off the independent sections of module m_topo_remap used by FV core into shared_topo_remap
   * write_eta.F90 added to prepare for a config file which eventually will replace m_set_eta module
   * Add option to build HERMES_LIGHT

## [10.12.0] - 2020-03-09

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

Major changes are:

1. Fixed "zero-diff" issue related to GF evaporation vs total rain, fixed GF cloud-mass-flux scaling issue.

2. Move ShallowCu contribution to mass flux and add scale-dependent stochastics to convection.

## [10.11.0] - 2020-03-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

Major changes are:

1. RRTMG_SW:
   Updates RRTMG_SW in GEOS to be equivalent to RRTMG_SW v4.10. This fix increases the heating rates near the stratospause region and is a non zero-diff change.

2. RAS_NO_NEG:
   Provides an optional flag that ensures RAS results are non-negative. This is an important fix for chemical species that was extremely useful in the Icarus but did not make it into Jason. The fix is "off" by default and therefore zero-diff.

3. Plots:
 * Enable additional upper levels for forecast stats plots.
 * Add QITOT & QLTOT to horizontal plots.
 * Add aerosols to time series plots.

Other updates:
   * Remove #PBS pragmas at NCCS to use #SBATCH.
   * Brought the chem setup scripts in line with gcm_setup.
   * Bug fixes for gcm_run and gcm_forecast scripts.

## [10.10.0] - 2020-02-20

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

This release is equivalent to the [NOAA 2019.01.01 Release](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/releases/tag/2019.01.01) but with the addition of GEOS constants controlled by `-DMAPL_MODE`. Additional changes allow building with CMake.

## [10.9.0] - 2020-02-13

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

This release is equivalent in physics to v10.8.0 but now uses [MAPL
2.0](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/MAPL/releases/tag/v2.0.0). The release
is non-zero-diff due to the use of ESMF regridding for History and
ExtData.

Also, this version of GEOSgcm now uses the new PFIO IO server to handle
History and ExtData file access and writing. By default, these IO
servers run on the same resources (i.e., nodes) as the application.
However, `gcm_setup` and `gcm_run.j` have been altered so that, by
default, at high-resolution (C180+) the IO servers are on separate nodes
for performance and memory reasons.

## [10.8.0] - 2020-02-06

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO (only if AOIL_COMP_SWITCH=ON)

Recoded atmosphere-ocean interface layer (AOIL). Provides an option to exercise old/new versions of the AOIL.

1. Old version (AOIL_COMP_SWITCH = ON):
Default. Using the old interface is still non-zero diff to x0039, however, shown to be statistically insignificant in terms of forecast skill scores. Restarts with old interface can be used as is.

2. New version (AOIL_COMP_SWITCH = OFF):
If the new interface is turned on, then the user must provide additional fields in the internal state. Contact Santha Akella for a utility to do that.

## [10.7.0] - 2020-02-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Zero-diff to CVS tag Jason-3_5_aoil

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Correction to RRTMG Shortwave 'layreffr' variable to reduce stratospheric cold bias.
2. Stats plots updates to produce stratospheric forecast statistics up to 1mb.
3. Correction to gcm_run.j & gcm_forecast.tmpl related to REPLAY with GAAS aod files.

## [10.6.0] - 2020-01-31

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Atmospheric constituents (aersols, co, co2, etc) are now transported through moist/GF. This is equivalent to the way transport is handled in f525land_fpp/f525_fp.
2. Added exports for nitrate tendency and other fluxes related to GF convection.
3. Added nitrate tendency to history templates.
4. Upgraded to GEOSchem_GridComp to v1.1.0.
5. Set the default k_split = 2.
6. Fixed gcm_convert.j to work consistent with how gcm_setup and gcm_run.j interact.

## [10.5.0] - 2020-01-24

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (but user must setup experiment differently)

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Hotfixed a bug to enable regridding of catchement restarts from MERRA2
2. REPLAY updates:

   The REPLAY algorithm within the GEOSagcm has been modified to enable a 4DIAU methodology consistent with that used in DAS mode. Prior to this release, REPLAY could only incorporate one analysis increment within the CORRECTOR_DURATION window (nominally 6-hours). The 4DIAU update allows for multiple analysis increments to be used within the CORRECTOR window. The number of increments that wiil be used is determined by the settings of the REPLAY_FILE_FREQUENCY (in nnnnnn seconds format) and the REPLAY_FILE_REFERENCE_TIME (in HHMMSS format). Based on these two settings, the code will determine how many analysis increments will properly fit within the CORRECTOR window. Note: the previous setting of PREDICTOR_DURATION is no longer needed since the code computes the required length automatically.

   The updated algorthm allows for 2 types of REPLAY:

     1. Exact     (Uses Archived Increment Files)

        Exact REPLAYs identically reproduce (bit-for-bit) a previous GEOS DAS experiment by simply using the archived IAU forcing from the DAS experiment. For these cases, only the CORRECTOR step is employed and is, therefore, as efficient as a stand-alone model run.

     2. Regular  (Uses Archived Analysis/Assimilation Files)

        Regular REPLAYs are used to mimic the original IAU methodology, i.e., both the PREDICTOR and the CORRECTOR steps are employed. The key difference being that the Analysis is based on archived datasets. These Analyses may be from the GEOS DAS system, or from any other source that is written using the appropriate GEOS DAS ana.eta data format.

   For more detailed information, please see the comments within the AGCM.rc.tmpl file.

## [10.4.0] - 2020-01-13

7. Bug fix for comments using GNU compilers with Ninja.

## [10.3.5] - 2019-11-07

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Enable reading netCDF increments during EXACT replay.
2. Fixed issues affecting the MOIST aerosol diagnostics:
   1. incorrect mapping of tracer names to diagnostics
   2. sign of the diagnostics by not allowing negative values.
3. New approach for increment diagnostics discussed in GEOSchem_GridComp v1.0.3.
4. OXIT and OXIM replaced with MTRI%PCHEM::OXIM and TRI%PCHEM::OXIT in most HISTORY files. OX increments due to moist and turblence are now computed using BundleIncrementMod.F90 and their names have been changed.

## [10.3.4] - 2019-10-01

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Fields out of the MTR bundle came in the "wrong" order and affected
the Henry's law constants. Hotfix to fetch field by name instead of by
index.
2. Fixed triangular pdf option in SHUW.
3. Update chemistry to v1.0.2 to run GMI and Stratchem. Updated the
StratChem and GMIchem setup scripts to better match gcm_setup.

2. Updates for Travis CI

## [10.3.2 / Jason-3_2] - 2019-08-02

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Changes in FV3 related to Horizontal Advection choices. (from Bill: JU_20190722_WMP)
2. Changes in FV3 dddmp (from 0.1 to 0.2, to improve stability)

## [10.3.1 / Jason-3_1] - 2019-06-13

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

### Model Changes

1. Updates to `GuestOcean_GridComp.F90` to re-sync OCEAN clock with
ATMOS clock when running Regular REPLAY together with DataOcean.
(non-zero diff)
2. Introduced code in MAPL_CFIO for HISTORY which corresponds to the
"fix_undef" utility used in MERRA-2 post-processing.  This creates
consistency between horizontally transformed and vertically interpolated
quantities and the target output level (i.e., values below surface are
UNDEF).
3. MKIAU has been modified to allow for REPLAYing to different vertical
resolution.  Results are zero-diff to previous versions if vertical
resolution is the same.
4. Updates to mk_restarts for Land/Catch.  Zero-diff when regrid.pl
points to standard (old-land) Icarus/Jason boundary area.

## [10.3.0 / Jason-3_0] - 2019-05-03

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO (with caveats)

Due to changes in import states and
diagnostics, these restarts have changed but are passive to the
prognostic restarts:

* irrad_internal_rst
* surf_import_rst
* tr_internal_rst
* turb_import_rst

### Model Changes

1. Zero-Diff update to FV3 dynamics to allow FV3+ADV option
2. Updates from Mike Manyin to his tag:  Jason-2_2_MEM_2
3. This tag primarily is a Merge between Jason-2_2 and Andrea Molod's
coupled tag.  This produces a non-zero diff to Jason-2_2 due to a
modified surface layer interface.

## [Jason-2_2] - 2019-04-25

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (in default mode)

### Restart Changes: NO (with caveats)

There was a long_name change in TR restart

### Model Changes

1. StratChem updated to tag: Jason-2_0_MEM_2, as well as updates to
GEOS-Chem and HEMCO from Mike Manyin
2. CARMA updated to tag: prc+asd-AeroChem-Icarus-3_3_p2+a1-v7 from Pete
Colarco (with minor mods in `DustEmissionMod.F90` because of an interface
differences)
3. GIT related updates.

## [Jason-2_1] - 2019-04-17

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (in default mode)

### Restart Changes: YES

* `turb_import_rst`: Simply Bootstrap.
* `surf_import_rst`: Simply Bootstrap.
* `irrad_internal_rst` (passive, for clear-sky diagnostics only): Simply Bootstrap

### Model Changes

1. Retuning when using NewLand.
2. Addition of Optional RRTMPG (off by Default).
3. Modifications for New RRTMG diagnostics.
4. Updates for regrid.pl and related code.
5. StratChem updated to tag: Jason-2_0_MEM_1
6. GIT related updates.

## [Jason-2_0] - 2019-03-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* `solar_internal_rst` (for RRTMG).  Simply Bootstrap.

### Model Changes

1. This is a MAJOR update to include updated moist processes based on the tag: merge_JDB7p1_retuned
  * It uses RRTMG for BOTH Shortwave and Longwave radiation.
  * It uses the GF Convection Scheme, as well as the UW Shallow Cumulus scheme.
  * It uses dynamics tunings based on the DYAMOND experiments.
2. Option included for running Stochastic Physics.
3. 2nd-Moment Cloud MicroPhysics updated to tag: b_Jason_2_0_donifan

## [Jason-1_1] - 2019-01-23

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* GOCART IMPORT was modified by adding LWI and FRACI to be non-skip
* TR IMPORT was modified by removing ALL but CLDTT (from RAD), since TR is run after SURF RUN(1,2)
* Note:  When TR adopts a 2-phase approach, additional IMPORT variables from SURF will need to be included.

### Model Changes

1. An error was found related to GOCART and TR regarding the TR
and GOCART IMPORT restarts.  This error was introduced going from
Icarus-1_0_p1 to Icarus-2_0 with the splitting of GOCART into RUN1 and
RUN2 methods.  Essentially, the ordering in PHYSICS is:  SURF,CHEM,TURB
RUN1, followd by SURF,TURB,CHEM RUN2.  Emissions are computed in CHEM
RUN1 based on LWI locations.  However, LWI is not computed until SURF
RUN2.  Therefore, LWI is required on the GOCART IMPORT.  But this
variable was labeled as RESTART_SKIP.  The TR IMPORT did contain LWI,
thus when TR was Enabled, GOCART saw the proper LWI.  But when TR was
Disabled, LWI was no longer available for GOCART, and resulted in
non-zero differences.  The quick solution was to label LWI as non-skip
on the GOCART IMPORT restart.
2. An error was found related to the TH_for_CHEM within the SYNC-TQ
sequence.  The error was fixed, but experiments showed negligible impact
due to its second-order influence.
3. Modifications to the STATS plotting package to include Mean-Square-Error decompostion.

## [Jason-1_0_BETA] -- 2018-09-17

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* `saltwater_internal` ==> `openwater_internal` & `seaicethermo_internal`

### Model Changes

1. Saltwater split => openwater and seaicethermo.  This means
`saltwater_internal` is now two files: `openwater_internal` and
`seaicethermo_internal`. `saltwater_import` remains. Regridding utility
(`regrid.pl`) will always produce the split ocean with this tag.  You can,
however, provide the single `saltwater_internal` as input.
2. Sponge Layer fix in FV3 to include damping between top model layer and bottom of sponge.
3. Regridding in MAPL now done in a new abstract/OO paradigm. This leads
to the new grid definitions in AGCM.rc
4. New HISTORY.rc grid_label definitions.  This HISTORY is designated as
VERSION: 1.  Older HISTORY files (using resolution attribute) will still
work provided VERSION = 0.
5. QUICKPLOT updates to produce automated "closeness" plots.
