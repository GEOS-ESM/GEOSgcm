## [10.12.1] - 2020-03-27

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES

### Restart Changes: NO except moist_internal has an additional 3 fields: NGRAUPEL, NRAIN, NSNOW

Major changes are:

1. Broader support for various computing environments including SLES12. Adds a new question to gcm_setup (and other setup scripts) that asks a user what type of processor to run on. It then uses the "default" number of cores per those processors to better figure out how to handle the IOserver nodes.
2. Changes that enable MAPL2 GEOS to work with MPT at NCCS.
3. Changed REPLAY_Shutoff alarm from NON-STICKY to STICKY, and used it in GAAS to stop updates in forecasts during REPLAY mode.

## [10.12.0] - 2020-03-09

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

Major changes are:

2. Move ShallowCu contribution to mass flux and add scale-dependent stochastics to convection.

## [10.11.0] - 2020-03-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

Major changes are:

1. RRTMG_SW:
   Updates RRTMG_SW in GEOS to be equivalent to RRTMG_SW v4.10. This fix increases the heating rates near the stratospause region and is a non zero-diff change.
   
2. RAS_NO_NEG:
   Provides an optional flag that ensures RAS results are non-negative. This is an important fix for chemical species that was extremely useful in the Icarus but did not make it into Jason. The fix is "off" by default and therefore zero-diff.
   
3. Plots:
 * Enable additional upper levels for forecast stats plots.
 * Add QITOT & QLTOT to horizontal plots.
 * Add aerosols to time series plots.

Other updates:
   * Remove #PBS pragmas at NCCS to use #SBATCH.
   * Brought the chem setup scripts in line with gcm_setup.
   * Bug fixes for gcm_run and gcm_forecast scripts.

## [10.10.0] - 2020-02-20

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

This release is equivalent to the [NOAA 2019.01.01 Release](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/releases/tag/2019.01.01) but with the addition of GEOS constants controlled by `-DMAPL_MODE`. Additional changes allow building with CMake.

## [10.9.0] - 2020-02-13

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

This release is equivalent in physics to v10.8.0 but now uses [MAPL
2.0](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/MAPL/releases/tag/v2.0.0). The release
is non-zero-diff due to the use of ESMF regridding for History and
ExtData.

Also, this version of GEOSgcm now uses the new PFIO IO server to handle
History and ExtData file access and writing. By default, these IO
servers run on the same resources (i.e., nodes) as the application.
However, `gcm_setup` and `gcm_run.j` have been altered so that, by
default, at high-resolution (C180+) the IO servers are on separate nodes
for performance and memory reasons. 

## [10.8.0] - 2020-02-06

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO (only if AOIL_COMP_SWITCH=ON)

Recoded atmosphere-ocean interface layer (AOIL). Provides an option to exercise old/new versions of the AOIL.

1. Old version (AOIL_COMP_SWITCH = ON):
Default. Using the old interface is still non-zero diff to x0039, however, shown to be statistically insignificant in terms of forecast skill scores. Restarts with old interface can be used as is.

2. New version (AOIL_COMP_SWITCH = OFF):
If the new interface is turned on, then the user must provide additional fields in the internal state. Contact Santha Akella for a utility to do that.

## [10.7.0] - 2020-02-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Zero-diff to CVS tag Jason-3_5_aoil

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Correction to RRTMG Shortwave 'layreffr' variable to reduce stratospheric cold bias.
2. Stats plots updates to produce stratospheric forecast statistics up to 1mb.
3. Correction to gcm_run.j & gcm_forecast.tmpl related to REPLAY with GAAS aod files.

## [10.6.0] - 2020-01-31

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Atmospheric constituents (aersols, co, co2, etc) are now transported through moist/GF. This is equivalent to the way transport is handled in f525land_fpp/f525_fp.
2. Added exports for nitrate tendency and other fluxes related to GF convection.
3. Added nitrate tendency to history templates.
4. Upgraded to GEOSchem_GridComp to v1.1.0.
5. Set the default k_split = 2.
6. Fixed gcm_convert.j to work consistent with how gcm_setup and gcm_run.j interact.

## [10.5.0] - 2020-01-24

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (but user must setup experiment differently)

### Restart Changes: NO

1. Hotfixed a bug to enable regridding of catchement restarts from MERRA2
2. REPLAY updates:

   The REPLAY algorithm within the GEOSagcm has been modified to enable a 4DIAU methodology consistent with that used in DAS mode. Prior to this release, REPLAY could only incorporate one analysis increment within the CORRECTOR_DURATION window (nominally 6-hours). The 4DIAU update allows for multiple analysis increments to be used within the CORRECTOR window. The number of increments that wiil be used is determined by the settings of the REPLAY_FILE_FREQUENCY (in nnnnnn seconds format) and the REPLAY_FILE_REFERENCE_TIME (in HHMMSS format). Based on these two settings, the code will determine how many analysis increments will properly fit within the CORRECTOR window. Note: the previous setting of PREDICTOR_DURATION is no longer needed since the code computes the required length automatically.

   The updated algorthm allows for 2 types of REPLAY:

     1. Exact     (Uses Archived Increment Files)
     
        Exact REPLAYs identically reproduce (bit-for-bit) a previous GEOS DAS experiment by simply using the archived IAU forcing from the DAS experiment. For these cases, only the CORRECTOR step is employed and is, therefore, as efficient as a stand-alone model run.
     
     2. Regular  (Uses Archived Analysis/Assimilation Files)

        Regular REPLAYs are used to mimic the original IAU methodology, i.e., both the PREDICTOR and the CORRECTOR steps are employed. The key difference being that the Analysis is based on archived datasets. These Analyses may be from the GEOS DAS system, or from any other source that is written using the appropriate GEOS DAS ana.eta data format.

   For more detailed information, please see the comments within the AGCM.rc.tmpl file.

1. Changes in FV3 related to Horizontal Advection choices. (from Bill: JU_20190722_WMP)
2. Changes in FV3 dddmp (from 0.1 to 0.2, to improve stability)
3. Changes in MOIST related to ICE-FALL. (from Bill: JU_20190722_WMP)
4. Updates to `GEOS_OpenWaterGridComp.F90` and `GEOS_DataSeaGridComp.F90`
to modify the original Coupled/Merged System to
include Santha's reformulated ice/melt. (from Santha:
sakella-GEOSadas-5_25_0_DV_in_MIZ_SSTunderIceFix)
5. Many updates related to CMAKE for upcoming GIT repository.
6. The addition of ERA5 to QUICKPLOT.

## [10.3.1 / Jason-3_1] - 2019-06-13

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO

### Model Changes

1. Updates to `GuestOcean_GridComp.F90` to re-sync OCEAN clock with
ATMOS clock when running Regular REPLAY together with DataOcean.
(non-zero diff)
2. Introduced code in MAPL_CFIO for HISTORY which corresponds to the
"fix_undef" utility used in MERRA-2 post-processing.  This creates
consistency between horizontally transformed and vertically interpolated
quantities and the target output level (i.e., values below surface are
UNDEF).
3. MKIAU has been modified to allow for REPLAYing to different vertical
resolution.  Results are zero-diff to previous versions if vertical
resolution is the same.
4. Updates to mk_restarts for Land/Catch.  Zero-diff when regrid.pl
points to standard (old-land) Icarus/Jason boundary area.

## [10.3.0 / Jason-3_0] - 2019-05-03

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: NO (with caveats)

Due to changes in import states and
diagnostics, these restarts have changed but are passive to the
prognostic restarts:

* irrad_internal_rst 
* surf_import_rst
* tr_internal_rst
* turb_import_rst

### Model Changes

1. Zero-Diff update to FV3 dynamics to allow FV3+ADV option
2. Updates from Mike Manyin to his tag:  Jason-2_2_MEM_2
3. This tag primarily is a Merge between Jason-2_2 and Andrea Molod's
coupled tag.  This produces a non-zero diff to Jason-2_2 due to a
modified surface layer interface.

## [Jason-2_2] - 2019-04-25

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (in default mode)

### Restart Changes: NO (with caveats)

There was a long_name change in TR restart

### Model Changes

1. StratChem updated to tag: Jason-2_0_MEM_2, as well as updates to
GEOS-Chem and HEMCO from Mike Manyin
2. CARMA updated to tag: prc+asd-AeroChem-Icarus-3_3_p2+a1-v7 from Pete
Colarco (with minor mods in `DustEmissionMod.F90` because of an interface
differences)
3. GIT related updates.

## [Jason-2_1] - 2019-04-17

### Zero-diff to previous release: YES (in default mode)

### Restart Changes: YES

* `turb_import_rst`: Simply Bootstrap.
* `surf_import_rst`: Simply Bootstrap.
* `irrad_internal_rst` (passive, for clear-sky diagnostics only): Simply Bootstrap

### Model Changes

1. Retuning when using NewLand.
2. Addition of Optional RRTMPG (off by Default).
3. Modifications for New RRTMG diagnostics.
4. Updates for regrid.pl and related code.
5. StratChem updated to tag: Jason-2_0_MEM_1
6. GIT related updates.

## [Jason-2_0] - 2019-03-04

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* `solar_internal_rst` (for RRTMG).  Simply Bootstrap.

### Model Changes

1. This is a MAJOR update to include updated moist processes based on the tag: merge_JDB7p1_retuned
  * It uses RRTMG for BOTH Shortwave and Longwave radiation.
  * It uses the GF Convection Scheme, as well as the UW Shallow Cumulus scheme.
  * It uses dynamics tunings based on the DYAMOND experiments.
2. Option included for running Stochastic Physics.
3. 2nd-Moment Cloud MicroPhysics updated to tag: b_Jason_2_0_donifan

## [Jason-1_1] - 2019-01-23

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* GOCART IMPORT was modified by adding LWI and FRACI to be non-skip
* TR IMPORT was modified by removing ALL but CLDTT (from RAD), since TR is run after SURF RUN(1,2)
* Note:  When TR adopts a 2-phase approach, additional IMPORT variables from SURF will need to be included.
 
### Model Changes

1. An error was found related to GOCART and TR regarding the TR
and GOCART IMPORT restarts.  This error was introduced going from
Icarus-1_0_p1 to Icarus-2_0 with the splitting of GOCART into RUN1 and
RUN2 methods.  Essentially, the ordering in PHYSICS is:  SURF,CHEM,TURB
RUN1, followd by SURF,TURB,CHEM RUN2.  Emissions are computed in CHEM
RUN1 based on LWI locations.  However, LWI is not computed until SURF
RUN2.  Therefore, LWI is required on the GOCART IMPORT.  But this
variable was labeled as RESTART_SKIP.  The TR IMPORT did contain LWI,
thus when TR was Enabled, GOCART saw the proper LWI.  But when TR was
Disabled, LWI was no longer available for GOCART, and resulted in
non-zero differences.  The quick solution was to label LWI as non-skip
on the GOCART IMPORT restart.
2. An error was found related to the TH_for_CHEM within the SYNC-TQ
sequence.  The error was fixed, but experiments showed negligible impact
due to its second-order influence.
3. Modifications to the STATS plotting package to include Mean-Square-Error decompostion.

## [Jason-1_0_BETA] -- 2018-09-17

### Zero-diff to previous release: NO

### Restart Changes: YES

* `saltwater_internal` ==> `openwater_internal` & `seaicethermo_internal`
 
### Model Changes

1. Saltwater split => openwater and seaicethermo.  This means
`saltwater_internal` is now two files: `openwater_internal` and
`seaicethermo_internal`. `saltwater_import` remains. Regridding utility
(`regrid.pl`) will always produce the split ocean with this tag.  You can,
however, provide the single `saltwater_internal` as input.
2. Sponge Layer fix in FV3 to include damping between top model layer and bottom of sponge.
3. Regridding in MAPL now done in a new abstract/OO paradigm. This leads
to the new grid definitions in AGCM.rc
4. New HISTORY.rc grid_label definitions.  This HISTORY is designated as
VERSION: 1.  Older HISTORY files (using resolution attribute) will still
work provided VERSION = 0.
5. QUICKPLOT updates to produce automated "closeness" plots.
